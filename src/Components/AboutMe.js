                        <p>
                            I am a front-end web developer with proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, 
                            SASS, JavaScript, React, Redux and Git. Currently, I am taking a course on node.js so 
                            as to understand the backend part of web development and broaden my knowledge about
                            web development. I love to take up coding challenges as I believe this is the only way to
                            get better and become a software engineer. I believe there is no limit to what a man can achieve. 
                            Determination is key!

                    <p>I just want to sit in my bedroom, write codes and build wonderful solutions that help to
